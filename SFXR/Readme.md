# sfxr

This is the FPC port of the CPP version from Tomas Pettersson [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) application. The main purpose of the application is to create short sound effects like this "blib" and "blob" sounds we all like in computer games.

There are 2 ways of compiling the code (by setting the "UseBass" define or not)

* without bass.pas -> no sound preview available
* with bass.pass -> sound preview available

If you want to use bass.pas you need to download it from [here](https://www.un4seen.com/)

## Usage
Start the application, click one of the generator buttons (on the left). Or adjust the sliders by your own wish. Hit the play sound button to hear a preview of what you just defined. Export as .wav if you want to store the sound for later use.
