# ALT_F2

ALT_F2 is the keyboard shortcut Linux users typically use to open a quick starter application, that itself starts the searched and requested app.

This is the reimplementation of the KDE-Version of the ALT_F2 tool, but available for Windows and Linux.

I did this rewrite as i wanted to have a cool looking (and KDE looks cool), plattform independant version of the orig Linux version and came up with this.
With this tool your fingers learn a combination for a programm to start and no matter on which PC you are, its always the same. As it is also capable of starting explorer with a target directory you never need to learn new project folders if your boss is changing them "AGAIN". Just fix your shortcut and its done ;). 

This tool helps you clearing up your desktop from all this shortcuts to what ever, as it handles them all. And as the tool learns what you prefer, the longer you use it, the better are its suggestions.
