# Q Programmer

Q Programmer is the answer to all, who are asking me whether i would teach them programming skills. The program helps to answer the question if someone who is generally interested in coding has the special capabilities to have success.

In my opinion a good coder need to have some characteristics like:

- endurance
- creativity
- open minded
- ability to learn

In order to get the answer you only need to read the [Tutorial](tasks/tutorial_de.pdf) (attention its in german). And then try to solve the "Point_in_rect_*" task. At the end its not that important that you pass all tests (beside it would be nice). Furthermore after you ran through all that you proofed that you have all it need to get into it.
