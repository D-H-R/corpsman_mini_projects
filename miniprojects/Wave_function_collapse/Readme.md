# Wave function collapse

Inspired by the [Coding Challenge 171](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM) i tried to takle the wave function collapse function algorithms

The [Original](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse) sources are showing two variants:

- Tile model
- Overlapp model 

In the subfolders are the solutions i came up with.
